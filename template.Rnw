\begin{abstract}
This document provides a basic template for the 2-page labs we will complete each week. Here, you should provide a succint sumary about what you did and why it might be helpful. 
\end{abstract}

\noindent \textbf{Keywords:} What topics does the lab cover with respect to class? 

\section{Instructions}
For this lab, you will
\begin{enumerate}[1.]\itemsep0em
  \item Install \href{https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/}{R}. and \href{https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/}{RStudio}.
  \item Install tinytex (if necessary): \\ \texttt{install.packages("tinytex")}
  \item Create a GitHub account \href{https://github.com/}{here}, and email me your user-name
  \item Install \href{https://desktop.github.com/}{GitHub desktop}
  \item Accept the LAB 1 assignment \href{https://classroom.github.com/a/gfC_xMMl}{here}.
  \item recreate this document (except put your name/info at the top) to get used to writing in LATEX and to see the types of things we can do when creating a document to convey statistical information. make sure to commit and push your work to GitHub desktop as you finish each section.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Remark}
\noindent You will find the class Sweave cheatsheet to be \emph{incredibly} helpful.

\section{Word Processing Tasks}

\subsection{Centering Text}
\begin{center}
We can center text in Sweave.
\end{center} 

\subsection{Bold, Italics, and Underlining}
We can \textbf{bold}, \textit{italicize}, \underline{underline}, and \emph{emphasize} text in Sweave.

Note, I did a column break here so that the list wasn't broken across columns.\columnbreak 

\subsection{Lists, and Numbered Lists}
We can write an unordered list in Sweave
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0em
\item first item
\item second item
\item third item
\end{itemize}
We can write a numbered list in Sweave
\begin{enumerate}[1.]\itemsep0em
\item first item
\item second item
\item third item
\end{enumerate}
We can write a lettered list in Sweave
\begin{enumerate}[a.]\itemsep0em
\item first item
\item second item
\item third item
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Submissions}
This part of the midterm is due Sunday November 14 by 5p. I will not accept late submissions. Note that you may use this template to help build your introduction and methods sections, and you can use the work you did as a group during the datathon. Still, I expect this submission to be your own summary and extension of that work without collaboration.

\subsection{Typing Mathematial Equations}
We can write a one line equation that is centered like this
\[\widehat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i}+ \beta_2 x_{2i} +  \beta_3 x_{1i} x_{2i} + \epsilon_i.\]
This can be written in the text, as $\widehat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{1i}+ \beta_2 x_{2i} +  \beta_3 x_{1i} x_{2i} + \epsilon_i$. using as well.

To create a multi-line equation that is centered like this
\begin{align*}
8(x-5)+x &=9(x-5)+5 \\
8x-40+x &=9x-45+5 \tag{Distributing}\\
9x-40 &= 9x-40 \tag{combining like terms}\\
9x &=9x \tag{adding 40 to both sides}\\
x &=x \tag{dividing both sides by 9}
\end{align*}
The equality holds for any z.

Note, I did a page break here so that the next section started on a clean page. \pagebreak
\subsection{Running R Code}
Code chunks can be entered into Sweave; e.g, here are some comments.
<<size="scriptsize">>=
# R code goes here
# Output is automatically printed in the pdf
@

Below, you can see that we can do algebra with R.
<<size="scriptsize">>=
8*(9-5)+9 #8(x-5)+x for x=9
@

Below, we show we can produce the code without evaluating it.
<<eval=FALSE, size="scriptsize">>=
8*(9-5)+9 #8(x-5)+x for x=9
## [1] 41
@

Alternatively, we can produce the output without the code.
<<echo=FALSE, size="scriptsize">>=
8*(9-5)+9 #8(x-5)+x for x=9
@

We can also call object values from R directly.
<<size="scriptsize">>=
result <- 8*(9-5)+0 #8(x-5)+x for x=9
result.with.error <- result + rnorm(1,mean=0,sd=0.1)
result.with.error
@
\subsection{Plotting}
We can also plot with R.
<<size="scriptsize">>=
#Plot a histogram of random exponential data
hist(rexp(100))
@
Figure 1: A histogram of random exponentially distributed data, n=100
\subsection{Tables}
Below, we load and take a peek at some data about the death rates per 1000 in Virginia in 1940 (Molyneaux et al., 1947).
<<size="scriptsize">>=
data("VADeaths")
head(VADeaths) #take a peek of the data
@
\indent If we want to print this nicely, we can do so using the xtable packagr (Dahl et al., 2019), which we can refrence using the label (Table 1).
<<results="asis",size="scriptsize">>=
library(xtable)
colnames(VADeaths)<-c("Rural Male","Rural Female","Urban Male","Rural Female")
VADeaths.table<-xtable(VADeaths,label = "VADeaths.tab")
print(VADeaths.table,
table.placement = "H", include.rownames=FALSE, size = "small")
@
\indent Table 1: Death Rates per 1000 in Virginia

\section{Appendix}
Below is a table from a paper Iâ€™m currently working on. Without the analysis object in R, I have to create this table myself.

\indent The \texttt{palmerpenguins} package for R(Horst et al., 2020) provides data on adult foraging penguins near Palmer station, Antarctica. Figure 2 is too big to fit nicely in our column based template above, so I've placed it here in the abstract by saving it and presenting it scaled to 0.75.
